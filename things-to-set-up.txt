## better to dl R from CRAN repo using the Ubuntu deb file
## Build from source ## Or can consider downloading Ubuntu .deb from CRAN repo
R ## ./configure  --enable-R-shlib
## Depends: libxt-dev, libboost-dev, libx11-dev, libreadline-dev, g++, libc++-dev OR maybe libcppunit-dev, libgtk2.0-dev, mesa-common-dev, libpq-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev, libglu1-mesa-dev, libxml2-dev
## then R> install.packages(c("ggplot2","plyr","formatR", "deSolve", "shiny", "devtools", "knitr", "dplyr","reshape2","ggvis"), dependencies=TRUE)
## will cover a lot of good packages

## Install TeXLive
Download tar file
tar -xzf install-tl-unx.tar.gz
cd into directory
sudo ./install-tl  -> type i 
add to $PATH
check with echo $PATH in new terminal, or source ~/.bashrc in current terminal

## Things to install with pip
ipython, virtualenv

## Things to install in emacs
rainbow-mode, rainbow-delimeters, tabbar, adaptive-wrap, hlinum, highlight-indentation

## Things to change
Make terminal profile
Install Monaco-Linux.ttf and MonacoB2-Bold.otf
Play with .bashrc, .vimrc, .emacs

## Chinese keyboards
Install fcitx and many other similarly prefixed packages including: m17n, googlepinyin, wubi.
May need to uninstall ibus as well. Initially also install language packs in keyboard settings and possibly look into input method (didn't appear to help Linux Mint 19.1). Restarting with fcitx selected there and all these keyboards that are available can be selected in the fcitx configuration preferences.
CTRL+Shift+SPACE to see the options (CTRL+SPACE to switch between current and previous keyboards)

## To restore a Linux live USB
Restoring your USB key to its original state using Linux:

A. First we need to delete the old partitions that remain on the USB key.

Open a terminal and type sudo su
Type fdisk -l and note your USB drive letter.
Type fdisk /dev/sdx (replacing x with your drive letter)
Type d to proceed to delete a partition
Type 1 to select the 1st partition and press enter
Type d to proceed to delete another partition (fdisk should automatically select the second partition)
B. Next we need to create the new partition.

Type n to make a new partition
Type p to make this partition primary and press enter
Type 1 to make this the first partition and then press enter
Press enter to accept the default first cylinder
Press enter again to accept the default last cylinder
Type w to write the new partition information to the USB key
Type umount /dev/sdx1 (replacing x with your drive letter)
C. The last step is to create the fat filesystem.

Type mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdx1 (replacing x with your USB key drive letter)
That's it, you should now have a restored USB key with a single fat 32 partition that can be read from any computer.
